Sinhala AI News Page — Full Project Document
Last updated: November 15, 2025


1. Executive Summary
You will build an AI-powered web/mobile system that automatically collects global and entertainment news, summarizes and translates it into Sinhala, generates branded post images using an AI-driven template pipeline, and schedules/uploads the posts to a Facebook Page. The system must prioritize accuracy, originality (to avoid copyright issues), moderation, and growth/monetization.

This document contains: - Project goals & scope - MVP feature list - System architecture & components - Detailed data model & APIs - AI prompt templates and examples - Content moderation & legal guidance - Monetization options and growth tactics - Deployment, cost estimates, and roadmap - Operational checklist and launch plan


2. Goals & Success Criteria
Primary goal: Launch an automated, high-quality Sinhala news Facebook page that posts daily updates across categories (global news, cinema, comics/anime, tech), with attractive visuals and consistent tone.

Success metrics (first 6 months) - Reach: 100,000 monthly users (impressions) - Followers: 10,000 page likes/follows - Engagement: 1–3% engagement rate (likes/comments/shares) - Monetization: first sponsorship or ad revenue stream established


3. Target Audience

• Sinhala-speaking users in Sri Lanka and the global Sinhala diaspora
• Age groups: 16–40 (primary); 40–60 (secondary)
• Interests: global news, film/cinema, anime & cartoons, comics/gaming, pop culture


4. Scope: MVP vs Phase 2
MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
• News ingestion from 3–5 sources (news API + RSS)
• Automatic summarization and Sinhala translation
• Generate post text (headline, 2–3 sentence summary, hashtags)
• Auto-generate image using your template + AI image generator

• Scheduling & posting to Facebook Page (Graph API)
• Admin dashboard: review & approve posts, simple analytics
• Basic moderation rules (hate speech / disinformation filters)

Phase 2 / Nice-to-have
• Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)
• Deeper personalization / topic preference for followers
• Multi-platform posting (YouTube shorts, Instagram reels, X threads)
• Monetization dashboard & sponsor integrations
• More advanced analytics & A/B test image templates


5. Tech Stack Recommendations
Frontend
• Web dashboard: React + TypeScript (Next.js optional for SSR)
• Mobile (Phase 2): React Native or Flutter
• Styling: Tailwind CSS

Backend
• Node.js (TypeScript) / Fastify or Express OR Python (FastAPI)
• Worker queue: BullMQ (Redis) or Celery (if Python)
• Scheduler: Cron or a dedicated scheduler (Bull repeatable jobs)

AI & External Services
• LLM (summarization/translation): OpenAI GPT family or Anthropic/Claude
• Image generation: Stable Diffusion API, Midjourney, or OpenAI image API
• News ingestion: NewsAPI.org, GDELT, RSS feeds, Reddit/X scraping (with care)
• Translate fallback: Google Translate API or DeepL (if needed)

Database & Storage
• Relational DB: Postgres (primary) — posts, users, audits
• Cache/queue: Redis
• Blob storage: S3-compatible (DigitalOcean Spaces, AWS S3)

Hosting
• Backend & Dashboard: Vercel (frontend) + Render / DigitalOcean / AWS for backend
• Workers: Dockerized containers on ECS, Render, or DigitalOcean App Platform

Monitoring & Analytics
• Logging: Sentry
• Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana or SaaS (Datadog)

• Social analytics: built-in Facebook Insights + Google Analytics for website


6. System Architecture (high-level)
1. Ingest Layer: Scheduled crawlers (RSS/NewsAPI) collect articles & metadata.
2. Preprocessing: Deduplicate, extract lead paragraph, fetch images URLs (if allowed).
3. AI Pipeline: For each item: summarize ? translate to Sinhala ? generate post text ? create image prompt ? call image generator ? merge with template.
4. Moderation & Human-in-the-loop: Admin dashboard shows generated posts for approval (MVP: approve all before publish; later: auto-publish for low-risk categories).
5. Publishing: Post via Facebook Graph API (pages_publish) and store results & insights.
6. Analytics & Feedback Loop: Track engagement per post to improve prompts and templates.

(Implement all inter-component communication using queues so ingestion, ai-generation, and publishing are decoupled.)


7. Data Model (Core tables)

• id, name, type (rss/newsapi/reddit), url, allowed_to_extract_images (bool), last_checked_at


• id, source_id, external_id, title, url, content, published_at, fetched_at, language


• id, raw_article_id, headline_si, summary_si, tags, image_path, template_id, status (draft/generated/ published), scheduled_at, created_at, published_at, fb_post_id


• id, name, layout_json, font_si, headline_area_coords, logo_coords


• id, name, role (admin/editor), fb_access_token


• id, post_id, result, reason, checked_by_user_id, checked_at


• id, post_id, fb_metrics_json, fetched_at


8. News Ingestion — Concrete Plan
1. Priority feeds: NewsAPI (global headlines), selected RSS for entertainment and anime, Reddit r/ anime/r/movies for community buzz.
2. Dedupe rules: Match by URL or canonical ID; fuzzy title matching if URL missing.
3. Metadata extraction: Authors, published time, canonical image (only if license permits). If image usage is unclear, do not reuse — prefer AI-generated images.
4. Frequency: Critical breaking news: poll every 1–5 minutes; categories like anime/cinema: 15–30 min.


9. AI Prompts — Templates (use as starting point)
Important: Keep prompts short & explicit. Add system instructions for consistent Sinhala tone (neutral, clear, slightly conversational for social media).

Summarize & Translate (single-step prompt for cost-efficiency):

Headline-only shorter prompt (if using separate step):
• "Write a punchy Sinhala headline for social media based on: {title}"

Image-prompt generator template (for image API):

Tone instructions (system):
• Use neutral, trustworthy Sinhala. Avoid speculation. If uncertain about facts, add: "Source: {source}"


10. Image Generation & Template Merge
Steps
1. Generate base image from prompt (Stable Diffusion / OpenAI). Use a safe-for-work aesthetic.
2. Overlay a semi-transparent rectangle at the top/center for the Sinhala headline (use your chosen font).
3. Add your page logo and small watermark if desired.
4. Export PNG (1080x1080 for FB feed; 1200x630 for link posts).

Technical options for merging


• Node.js:

to composite images & render Sinhala text (use

or a text-to-image

library supporting fonts).

• Python:

+

(requires embedding Sinhala fonts).


Font & Sinhala rendering
• Use a reliable Sinhala font (e.g., Noto Sans Sinhala). Ensure server supports complex script rendering (Pango + Cairo or appropriate text shaping library).


11. Facebook Posting & API


• Use Graph API's

or

endpoints for images and link posts.

• Use long-lived page access tokens (obtain via a user token + exchange to long-lived token).
• Respect rate limits. Implement retry/backoff and log failures.

Security: never store raw user-level tokens in plaintext; use encrypted secrets (Vault/Env secrets manager).


12. Content Moderation & Fact-checking
Moderation rules (automated):
• Block explicit sexual content, hate speech, calls for violence.
• Flag named-entity controversies — pass to human reviewer.
• Use LLM classifier to detect misinformation risk: if LLM returns "low confidence", route to human-in- loop.
Human in the loop:
• Admin dashboard should show flagged posts first.
• Provide quick edit buttons: regenerate summary, change headline, replace image.


13. Legal & Copyright Guidance
• Text summaries: You can summarize news in your own words — that is generally allowed. Do not reproduce full articles.
• Images: Avoid republishing copyrighted images without permission. Use AI-generated images or license-free images (Unsplash / Pexels) with care.
• Attribution: When summarizing, include a short source note (e.g., "Source: BBC"), especially for direct factual claims.
• Defamation: Avoid unverified accusations about persons; follow conservative content policy.

Consider getting local legal advice before monetizing at scale.


14. Monetization Plan (timeline & options)
1. Phase 0 (0–3 months) - Build audience organically. Focus on quality.
2. Phase 1 (3–6 months) - Affiliate links (movies, streaming referrals), sponsored posts.
3. Phase 2 (6–12 months) - Partner with content creators, local businesses; apply for Facebook monetization if audience is eligible (audience location matters).
4. Other: Launch a website with AdSense; sell premium newsletter; offer promoted posts to local businesses.


15. Growth & Marketing Suggestions

• Post frequency: 3–6 posts/day across timezones
• Use short videos or carousels occasionally — these drive engagement.
• Cross-post to Telegram/WhatsApp groups for viral reach.
• Collaborate with Sinhala influencers for shoutouts.
• Run small-paid FB boosts for top-performing content.


16. Analytics & Iteration
Track per-post: - Impressions, reach - Click-throughs (if link) - Likes, comments, shares - Follower growth

Feed top-performing posts back into prompt tuning: analyze which headlines and image styles perform best and automate template selection.


17. Security & Operational Notes

• Rotate tokens monthly.
• Audit access logs for admin accounts.
• Rate limit public APIs from your servers to avoid being blacklisted.


18. Cost Estimate (monthly, rough)

• Hosting (backend + DB): $20–150 (DigitalOcean / Render small instances)
• Storage (images): $5–50
• AI API usage (LLM + image gen): $50–500 depending on scale and model choice
• Misc (CDN, monitoring): $10–50

Total early-stage monthly estimate: ~$100–$700.


19. Roadmap & Milestones (12-week plan)
